# Billy's Billing: Magento

### How to use
A link to Magento Connect will soon be given here, for easier installation.

When installed on your Magento store, there's only a single step to follow;

Log in to your Magento administration panel, and go to _System_ -> _Configuration_ -> _Billy's Billing_, and input your API key.

You're ready to go. The integration will listen for invoices, and credit memos from now on.

### Todo
- Better automation
- More to come, suggestions?
