# Magento: Billy's Billing

**This integration is still in an early alpha. Use with caution, I am not to be held responsible for anything that might go wrong**

### How to use
Simply download the code source, by clicking the "Download ZIP" in the right side of this page. If you're a bit more advanced, you can do a `git clone` or whatever you like.

Extract the archive, and upload it to your document root on your FTP, and go on. Log in to your Magento administration panel, and go to _System_ -> _Configuration_ -> _Billy's Billing_, and input your API key, and simply use `https://api.billysbilling.com/v2` as your API URI.

You're ready to go. The integration will listen for invoices, and credit memos from now on.
